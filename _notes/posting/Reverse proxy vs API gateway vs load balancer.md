## Reverse proxy vs API gateway vs load balancer  

![[Pasted image 20250531194647.png]]

As modern websites and applications are like busy beehives, we use a variety of tools to manage the buzz. Here we'll explore three superheroes: Reverse Proxy, API Gateway, and Load Balancer.  
  
🔹Reverse Proxy: change identity  
- Fetching data secretly, keeping servers hidden.  
- Perfect for shielding sensitive websites from cyber-attacks and prying eyes.  
  
🔹API Gateway: postman  
- Delivers requests to the right services.  
- Ideal for bustling applications with numerous intercommunicating services.  
  
🔹Load Balancer: traffic cop  
- Directs traffic evenly across servers, preventing bottlenecks  
- Essential for popular websites with heavy traffic and high demand.  
  
In a nutshell, choose a Reverse Proxy for stealth, an API Gateway for organized communications, and a Load Balancer for traffic control. Sometimes, it's wise to have all three - they make a super team that keeps your digital kingdom safe and efficient.
